# gatsby-starter-minimal
The Gatsby starter with `typescript`, `eslint`, `prettier`, `stylelint`,
`styled-components`, `styled-system` and `graphql-codegen`. This starter aims
to have a minimal code boilerplate to get a simple start. Mostly created for my
own personal needs.

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby
documentation - Building with
Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).

## Install

```sh
gatsby new gatsby-example-site https://github.com/danbruegge/gatsby-starter-minimal/
